=clingon= version =0.4.0= has been tagged.

- Added Github Actions to automatically test the =clingon= system.
- Exported =CLINGON:PARSE-INTEGER-OR-LOSE=
- Export symbols to control the default list of options for newly
  created commands. See [[https://github.com/dnaeon/clingon/issues/4][issue #4]]
- =CLINGON:FIND-OPTION= can now search for options by their keys
- =CLINGON:GETOPT= returns three values -- the option value, a boolean
  indicating whether the option was set, and the command which
  provided the option.
- If =--version= is specified for any command, then =clingon= will try
  to find a parent command with an associated version string, if the
  sub-command does not provide it's own version string.
- Added =CLINGON:GETOPT*= which will return the first value from the
  command's lineage, for which the option was defined and set.
- Added =CLINGON:IS-OPT-SET-P*= predicate
- Additional tests related to =CLINGON:GETOPT= and =CLINGON:GETOPT*=
- Added support for /persistent/ options. A /persistent/ option is an
  option which is propagated from parent to all sub-commands. Please
  refer to the documentation for more details and examples.
- =CLINGON:PRINT-DOCUMENTATION= can generate the tree representation
  for commands in [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DOT_(graph_description_language)][Dot]] format.

This is how the generated tree for the =clingon-demo= app looks like.
